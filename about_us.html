		<li><p>Steph's Spot is a family run business that opened in early summer 1989. It started as a man selling barbeque to all his neighbors and developed into much more. </p></li>
		
		<li><p>At first, the owner, Don would sell plates to all the neighbors from a stand he had set up in his driveway. He was well known in the neighborhood for having delicious grilled and smoked meats.</p></li>
		
		<li><p>One day, one of the neighbors asked if he would cater her graduation party and the rest was history. </p></li>
	
		<li><p>He went into business for himself with the help of his wife and he decided to name the business after their daughter, Stephanie. The family have been serving up good home cooking ever since!</p></li><br>
